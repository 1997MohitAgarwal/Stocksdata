Next.js: The React Framework
for Production.
Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.

Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center` and `rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

Example:
```html
<div className="bg-slate-800 text-xl p-2 border border-gray-100">
  <p className="m-2 text-white">TailwindCSS and Next.js</p>
  <a href="..." className="text-red-300">Visit the documentation</a>
</div>
```
